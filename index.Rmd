## A Typical Chart

```{r results = 'asis', commment = NA, message = F, echo = F}
require(googleVis)
barchart <- gvisBarChart(fedbyprovince[fedbyprovince$Year == 2014,], 
                         xvar="Province", 
                         yvar=c("Employees"),
                         options=list(isStacked=FALSE,orientation="horizontal",                                                                                       
                                      hAxis="{title:'Province or Territory',format:'####'}",
                                      vAxis="{title: 'Employees'}",
                                      legend="{position: 'none'}",
                                      width=1000,
                                      height=500,
                                      title=paste("Federal Employees by Province for ","2014","")))

print(barchart, tag='chart')
